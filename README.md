## Features

- Download videos from 1000+ supported sites (via [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp))
- MP4 video or MP3 audio extraction
- Quality/resolution picker
- Bulk downloads — paste multiple URLs at once
- Automatic URL deduplication
- Clean, responsive UI — no frameworks, no build step
- Single-file Go backend — stdlib only, compiles to one binary

## Quick Start

```bash
brew install go ffmpeg yt-dlp   # or apt install golang ffmpeg
git clone https://github.com/azhai/reclip.git
cd reclip
make
./bin/reclip
```

> yt-dlp needs no manual install: the Go service uses the one on `PATH`, or
> auto-downloads a standalone build into `./bin` on first start. It self-updates
> only that standalone build on every start (skip with `RECLIP_NO_UPDATE=1`); a
> system yt-dlp (e.g. Homebrew) is left to its own package manager to update.

Open **http://localhost:8899**.

## Usage

## Chrome Extension (optional)

A lightweight companion extension lives in [`extension/`](extension/) (Manifest V3, vanilla JS, no build step):

- **Right-click** any video link, media element, or page → *ReClip → 用 ReClip 下载* opens the panel with the URL pre-filled and auto-fetches
- **Toolbar popup** — download the current tab, toggle MP4/MP3, and set the server address (default `http://127.0.0.1:8899`)

Install: open `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked** → select the `extension/` directory.
